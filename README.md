# Monty_hall_problem
Brute forcing the famous month hall problem.

At first i didnt really grasped the statistics behind this problem and wanted to make sure that the 33 vs 66 percent ratio was right so i created this program to test 100000 samples and see the results. And as the results shows that its right. Statistics can be very amazing sometimes. I wish i can understand it
